# awsprofile-cli

**Awsprofile** is a cli tool that enables you to change your aws profile easily and permanantly

All you have to do is
```
awsprofile
```
then select the profile that you want to work on and open a new terminal tab so that the changes are applied by your terminal.

For the time being, you can use `awsprofile` with only **zsh** but in the future I am going to integrate **awsprofile** with other **bash tools**.
